## Task 0. "Printout of bits"
Print an integer bitwise using a bit shift.

## Task 1. "Print lines in reverse"
An unknown number of lines are entered at the entrance to the program. You need to display them in the reverse order. Use dynamic memory.

## Task 2. "Diagonal in the matrix"
The program considers the sum of the diagonal elements of the matrix in the file. In addition, you need to write a program that will enter a matrix into this file. You also need to write a Makefile in order to speed up the process of compiling and linking this all. (Read about make and makefile.)

## Task 3. "Ring list"
An array of strings is fed into the program. It is necessary to create an element of a ring list for each line, then find the smallest lexicographic element and display a list starting with this element.

## Task 4. "Printout of the pids hierarchy of three sons"
There is a father process, he creates three sons, channel (s) between them. Each of the processes prints to stdout
Father: <pid father / son1 / son2 / son3>
Son1: <pid father / son1 / son2 / son3>
Son2: <pid father / son1 / son2 / son3>
Son3: <pid father / son1 / son2 / son3>
The repository presents implementations for one, two, and three descendants.

## Task 5. "Ping-Pong of three sons"
The sons of the processes are thrown by the signal, the so-called ball, and type "I'm son1 / son2 / son3: the value of the ball", where the value of the ball with each "hit" increases by 1.
