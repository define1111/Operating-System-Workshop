## Task 0. "Printout of bits"
Print an integer bitwise using a bit shift.

## Task 1. "Print lines in reverse"
An unknown number of lines are entered at the entrance to the program. You need to display them in the reverse order. Use dynamic memory.

## Task 2. "Diagonal in the matrix"
The program considers the sum of the diagonal elements of the matrix in the file. In addition, you need to write a program that will enter a matrix into this file. You also need to write a Makefile in order to speed up the process of compiling and linking this all. (Read about make and makefile.)
